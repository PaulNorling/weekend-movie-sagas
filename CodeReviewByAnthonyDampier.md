# Suggestions and review

## MovieList CSS

1. Image sizes can be set to avoid cross DB issues
    img {
        height: 300px;
        width: 200px;
    }

2. Solid use of box shadows
3. Got all genre information in movie details
4. Return function works great.

## Components 

1. Could make a component from movies.map() line 26-29 on App.jsx
##### Additional to above
    - can use useParams to create your details pages on the go; instead generating every movie's details on load.  

2. Neat use of <RingLoader/> in Header.jsx
